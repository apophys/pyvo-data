        You did it! You've overcome the first hurdle and feel ready to build a career.
        You still have a lot to learn - that's life in tech for you. But just having technical knowledge is rarely enough.
        So, how do you *actually* get a promotion?

        We'll talk about building a stable IT career in a typical corporate-like environment,
        and what steps you need to take to grow in them.

        The talk can be presented in Slovak or English based on audience's preferences.

        Veronika is a long term Pyvo attendee, working as a Senior Principal Software Engineer in Red Hat.
        Besides technical work, she also enjoys mentoring others.
